# Defining your user experience

**Workspace** as the name indicates, is a space that triniti provides you for you to do the bot building process. It is similar to a digital folder that you will be provided with, upon purchase to start with building your bot. 

## Create your very first workspace. 

> Before you could start, make sure you have a Triniti.ai account. If you do not have an account, go to triniti’s login page and create an account.
