## Workspaces

Workspaces are best described as Natural language understanding (NLU) modules. These modules can be included in your app, website or services. These help translate user requests into actionable data. A workspace can be thought of as a place where the user journey for different scenarios are described. It includes the training data for AI engine and workflow to execute the actions.
